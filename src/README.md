# Lab Notebook

This lab notebook contains my notes, thoughts, and plans for the various projects I work on.

## Sections
- The [Adafruit Airlift section](airlift/airlift.html) presents the data I gathered from reverse engineering the Airlift driver libraries.

- The [Atomic Force Microscope section](afm/atomic_force_microscope.html) contains some posts from my old blog about designing a pre-amplifier
for an atomic force microscope that I was building from scratch at one point.
